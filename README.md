# DeepHPM

PINN-based neural solver for Schrodinger 2D equation (Quantum Harmonic Oscillator).

This code needs to be extended to Deep Hidden Physics. Please see 

Schrodinger2D_DeepHPM.py => net_pde(.)

for details regarding the integration of HPM into our neural solver. Our most recent (and very alpha) code

Schrodinger2D_nh_hvd_v2.py

also requires training of several neural networks. You might borrow some ideas from that file.
