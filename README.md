# DeepHPM

DeepHPM-based PDE learning & neural solver for 2D Heat equation and 2D Schrodinger equation (Quantum Harmonic Oscillator).

The training code for Quantum Harmonic Oscilattor can be started by running 

`. src/train_hpm_schrodinger.sh`

in the root directory of this repository. Please make sure to set `$PYTHONPATH` such that it includes all module of our source direction:

`export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:src/`
